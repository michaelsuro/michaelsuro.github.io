                    <div class="col span-1-of-2 about-box">
                    	<p>I am a full stack iOS developer and mobile designer that has independently delivered four different applications to the App Store. Prior to building mobile apps I was the Director of Operations at <a href="https://www.getvenga.com">Venga</a> (acquired by <a href="https://www.bookingholdings.com">Booking Holdings Inc.</a>). At Venga I managed a team of operations specialists and worked shoulder to shoulder with developers in a product manager capacity. I began to teach myself how to code so I could become a more effective leader, and on the way bought a $9.99 video course on iOS development that changed everything. On a solo trip to India in 2015 I decided to quit my job and pursue iOS development full time. After nearly a year of teaching myself day and night I released <a href="#postable">Postable</a>. The following month I was connected to an influencer in the fashion and events space in New York City who had a vision for a networking app, less than a year later we had raised a $200k round of seed financing and released <a href="#cinq">Cinq</a>. As Cinq started to wind down in the fall of 2019 I recovered by working on a passion project purely for fun called <a href="#cities">The Cities</a>. Nowadays I’m developing apps as a contractor, supporting my latest project <a href="#flip">Flip flashcard maker</a>, and immersing myself in the world of SwiftUI.</p>
